# Meta-optimised-SVR
This code uses a genetic algorithm to optimise the C, epsilon and gamma parameters of a Support Vector Regressor. The SVR is multivariate, in case anyone is worrying. It uses eight different functions to check fitness, and minimises them simultaneously to achieve the best model. This is written in Python 3.6, using the DEAP and sklearn libraries.
